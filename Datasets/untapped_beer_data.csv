To cut it short, he and his partner bought the entire truckload, saving not just the beer, but quite literally our business.

James and Amy chose a hop bill that’s a firm family favourite. The initial sweetness off the palate gives way to a cleansing bitterness thanks to the use of Simcoe hops, providing lip-smacking pine-needle and fruity aromas, with Columbus hops bringing earthy and spicy notes.

Making M required a massive grain bill - seven seductive malts - boosted by strength-inducing Belgian candi sugar. Once original gravity hit 37 Plato, a frenzied fermentation ensued: four completely fabulous yeast strains, two of Belgian origin, transformed this sweet concoction into all that is beer. But not just any beer. A beer of madcap magnitude - 11.6% ABV. Character and complexity increased exponentialy while M meddled and mellowed for several months in all-American bourbon oak barrels. Blending the aged beer before bottling ascertained smoothness. M is mesmerizing, pouring dark and silky. Caramel and spice waft up from the glass; bourbon, molasses, leather and vanilla follow. The first taste proffers tobacco, burnt sugar and raisin with a sublime port-like finish, but bourbon - smooth, sensuous, brooding bourdon - is ever-present. The finish, a bit edgy like an American take on barley wine, provides the necessary leap toward overall balance.

It’s a blend of different bourbon barrel-aged vintages that have spent more than a year in wood. We blend the different barrels, and add a bit of freshly brewed Barley Wine to obtain the best possible version.

This year, the Barley Wine was brewed using a double-boil technique in which we evaporate the beer to a high concentration of sugar, add water back to the wort, and then boil it down again to increase Maillard reaction processes and build up some intense caramelization. We went easy on the hops to allow the malt and bourbon characteristics inherited from the barrels to be the champions of this beer.

The aromas and flavours are intense, and should be enjoyed slowly by serving at room temperature to allow even more layered nuances to shine through and add to the
beautiful complexity of this beer. We hope you enjoy this as much as we do.

The appearance is blood red with a thin, off-white head that lingers. Aroma is rich with deep caramel malt, toffee, and dark fruit notes. The rye whiskey character brings out more spice and oak than a bourbon barrel aged beer, which typically lends more coconut and vanilla. The high alcohol does not hide itself, but remains in balance with the thick body of the beer. While the beer coats the glass, it also coats the throat and mouth.

This is to be enjoyed over a long session so as not to rush the blossom of subtle floral characters in the aroma as the beer warms. When swirled, the rich malt and whiskey comes out and reminds you this is a beverage to be patient with and enjoyed slowly. This beer is ready to enjoy now, however it's built to age gracefully with proper cellaring.

Enjoy between 55° and 65°.",1.0

Xyauyù Kioke è una birra che unisce due grandi tradizioni artigiane legate al mondo della fermentazione: l’arte di produrre birra artigianale, incontra l’arte di produrre salsa di soia artigianale.

La birra, già fermentata e maturata per oltre 18 mesi, viene affinata “a cielo aperto” in una botte di Kioke nuova in cui non è stata fermentata la soia e che le dona note resinose di Cipresso e una leggera sfumatura acida, creando un profilo aromatico unico e originale.

Bourbon	90%
Oak High Toast	5%

To achieve the optimal quality of Oak Aged, Quadrupel has matured for three years in Bourbon barrels. This double-oaked bourbon with double maturation in oak creates an even more intensive taste. Furthermore, the flavour of Quadrupel remains well preserved. Quadrupel has a fine-pearled beige head on top of the clear mahogany-brown beer. Quadrupel’s initial scent is the familiar fruitiness and malty aroma with a strong presence of caramel. This is immediately followed by many wood aromas, such as vanilla, almond and also tobacco-like scents. With the first gulp, the bourbon comes across modestly, yet clearly and you taste the fine and even balance between bourbon whiskey and beer. The result is an Oak Aged beer with the richness of American oak aromas, lightly burnt, and followed by warmed alcohol and a soft but clear presence of bitterness. Due as well to the long maturing period, the complexity of this beer is extremely high and new taste associations keep surfacing. Carbonation keeps the taste refreshing in spite of the rather high sweetness and provides a nice tingling in the mouth.",1.0

Batch 33 has a dark amber colour, darker than the regular Quadrupel. The head is beige in colour and consists of very fine bubbles.

The main component of this batch spent 2 years maturing in American Bourbon Whiskey barrels from Kentucky. Due to this long maturation process and secondary fermentation in the bottle, the ABV has increased to almost 12%.

There are pronounced notes of Bourbon Whiskey in the nose and palate, with hints of vanilla, oak, almond and prunes. Batch 33 is extremely flavourful and complex,

resulting in a pleasant, even balance between La Trappe Quadrupel, Bourbon Whiskey and oak. New associations keep cropping up during the tasting process. Despite the considerable sweetness, the carbonation of the beer keeps it fresh and produces a pleasant tingling sensation.

The taste of alcohol is clearly present in the finish. As the beer warms up, the taste of the oak becomes more pronounced, the beer becomes richer in tannins and a soft note of vanilla creeps in.

A highly recommended beer, characterised by great complexity and a harmonious taste.

The cognac casks are made from French Limousin oak: traditionally the casks for cognac. This striking combination gives the batch a very complex, rich, fine aroma and flavour. The typical almond and vanilla scent of rum and the prominent, floral, sweet scent of cognac significantly enhance the aroma of Quadrupel.

Used Cognac barrel

100%

For this edition we only made use of French cognac barriques to age the Quadrupel for more than a year and a half. Cognac is a type of brandy originating from the Charente and Charante-Maritime departments in France. Prepared according to strictly monitored production methods and conditions,

cognac is distilled twice in so called copper “Pot Stills” before ageing in French oak barrels for at least two years. These unique barrels, known as barriques, are traditionally crafted from Limousin or Tronçais oak. To draw out the distinctive aroma and taste of the cognac, 100 per cent cognac Limousin barriques were used for this batch.

Batch 36 presents with a subtly pearled fine foam. Its dark colour makes it a significantly darker ale than the regular Quadrupel.

Highly subtle and refined cognac notes can be detected in the aroma, characterized by grapes, dried fruits, almond and nutmeg.

The taste can be described as warm and velvety smooth. The level of bitterness is lower than of the regular Quadrupel, also it is pushed to the background. The undertone of the ale is pleasantly sweet, partially due to the high alcohol content, which nears 12 per cent. Malty caramel and estery notes can be detected in the aftertaste, combined with oak and of course the cognac.

This Quadrupel Oak aged is unique in many ways.

Symbolically, a unique batch; the 25th Oak Aged batch during the 25th anniversary of La Trappe Quadrupel.

The head of this clear, amber-brown ale remains fragile – just like the head of batch 24 – resting on the ale like a thin silk blanket. This accentuates the scent of vanilla, followed by the scent of almond, honey, caramel, oak and malt. A refreshing scent clearly dominates, reminiscent of white wine (floral and slightly sour).

The first taste clearly gives the impression of La Trappe Quadrupel, undeniably followed by the refreshing and fruity wine aroma and shifting to an alcoholic heart-warming aftertaste. This aftertaste is emphasised even more by the aroma of the Kirsch, with a hint of cherries. Oak also has a clear and modest presence in the aftertaste, giving the ale a light smoky character.

Although it is only slightly carbonated, it fits in well with the desired serving temperature of 16°-18°. That way, the aromas of this uniquely smooth and delicate ale are fully effective.",1.0

Oak Aged Batch 22 was mainly matured on German Single Malt barrels. This whisky is considerably smoother and less ‘turfed’ than its Scottish counterparts, as a result of which batch 22 is much smoother than the previous batches that were matured on whisky barrels.
In addition to the malty and smoked aroma, banana, vanilla, honey, apple and blossom scent can also be distinguished. The whisky is clearly present but does not dominate, which means that La Trappe Quadrupel can still clearly be recognised. This results in a balanced fusion of flavours, releasing aromas of almond and smoke. Batch 22 is full of flavour and very complex; with every sip, new flavour associations seem to appear. The aftertaste clearly shows the alcohol, together with the bitterness of wood tannin, which lingers for a while. This may not be the most extreme batch, but thanks to its complexity and overall balanced flavour, we can really recommend it.",1.0

Batch 30 is presented with a fragile beige foam head and a warm gold/amber-coloured beer tone.

The difference is that this rum is always made entirely of freshly-squeezed sugar cane juice, which is what also gives it a distinct sugar cane taste.

The first impression in terms of scent is alcoholic with fruity rum hints of tropical fruit and several herbs, including ginger and liquorice. Just like the caramel and malt aromas, the oak is also clearly present, but not too prominently.

The taste is full to bombastic, with plenty of caramel, spices and ripe fruit. Without a doubt, you can recognise the flavours of ginger, dates, sweets, oak, smoke, and, of course, the remarkable bitterness of La Trappe Quadrupel.

At first impression, the aroma of this Quadrupel is highly complex, with hints of ripe black fruits (blueberry, bramble, plum, and cherry), vanilla, and sweet caramel.

New flavours continuously emerge. This batch is wine-like in flavour, with a heavy dose of oak. The alcohol is balanced out by the beer’s sweetness and mild bitterness. The classic Quadrupel taste remains present in the background. On the whole, this results in a spicy flavour palette.

The Oak Aged Batch 21 has a dark brown mahogany colour and a beige brown head. The soft aroma immediately reminds you of walnuts. Accompanied by a slightly smoky aroma, you can detect oak, caramel malt, alcohol, vanilla and, of course, French brandy. The flavour, although balanced, is not particularly mellow. The brandy barrels have clearly left a lot of wood influences, which manifest themselves in vanilla and almond. Additionally, the Quadrupel has a caramel-like, slightly sweet flavour with a good, full body. The flavour ends with a slightly burnt tone and a hint of wood tannin. Due to the light tingling of the carbonic acid, combined with the wood flavour and sweetness of the beer, the sensation in the mouth is full and pleasant.

Characteristic of Batch 34 is the dark amber-brown colour and the relatively fragile head. The most important ingredient of this batch is a red wine from Cahors, department Lot, that has matured well over 2.5 years in barriques of French Malbec. The grapes used for Malbec wines are full of colour and powerful tannins, which make for the distinctive rich taste and dark colour.

The first impression of the scent of this Oak Aged is complex and reminiscent of ripe black fruit, vanilla, cacao and tobacco. 

Contrary to Batch 31, for which Malbec wine barrel are used as well, the wood flavour in Batch 34 is enhanced by the relatively large amount of new wood that is used. In combination with the lengthy maturing period, this results in a very high level of wood tannins for an intense Oak Aged experience. 

Maturation has significantly reduced the bitterness, which makes the beer sweeter and softer than the normal Quadrupel.

The aftertaste brings out the taste of red wine, giving a pleasant, slightly sour finish.

The most important component of this batch has been matured in Cachaça barriques for two years. This is a sugar cane distillate from Brazil. Cachaça, like other types of rum, is made of sugar cane juice. The difference is that Cachaça is always 100% made of fresh sugar cane juice, which gives it this pronounced sugar cane flavour. The type of wood and the duration of the maturing process greatly influence the smell and flavour of the Cachaça.

Batch 35 presents itself with an elegantly-pearled head of foam and a deep, dark, amber-like beer colour.

The first aroma impression of this Oak Aged is highly complex, with fruity rum associations of tropical fruits and a wealth of herbs (including cinnamon and liquorice). Like the caramel and malt aromas, the oak definitely makes an appearance.

The taste is pleasantly sweet, silky soft, with the right fullness, and just a little boozy. The elegant and harmonious bitterness of La Trappe Quadrupel has been beautifully retained. Upon tasting, you will recognise the flavours of Cachaça, dates, prunes, ginger, oak and smoke. The long maturing process has provided this beer with a character that is fully its own.

As the beer warms up, the taste of oak becomes more emphasised and the beer becomes more tannin-rich and dryer in its finish.

This created a unique Trappist ale with a well-balanced taste and a unique oak aroma.

The complex taste depends on the type of barrel used for ageing the ale and therefore differs per batch. The ale undergoes secondary fermentation in the bottle, it can be kept for many years and is pure indulgence for the true ale lover.

Batch #37: 100% Wood

This truly remarkable Oak Aged batch consists of a mixture of oak, acacia and cherry wood barriques with medium and heavy toasting, in which the Quadrupel was allowed to age quietly for up to 2.5 years.

Previous La Trappe Quadrupel Oak Aged batches predominantly employed barrels that had been used to age spirits and wines. This time, we decided to use only unused barriques to create a unique signature of several types of European wood.

Batch 37 has a beautiful and firm layer of beige foam. Thanks to the long period of wood ageing, the beer has taken on a wonderful dark colour, going way beyond your normal Quadrupel ale.

The remarkable combination of wood types used for this batch yields a truly complex, rich and fine fragrance and taste. Long ageing in several kinds of unused barriques gives the La Trappe Quadrupel that typical wood aroma, with a scent that hints at plenty of vanilla, almond, cocoa and caramel.

21,La Trappe Quadrupel Oak Aged Batch #32,Belgian Quadrupel,Bierbrouwerij De Koningshoeven,4.24,"2,084",11% ABV,08/20/18,"The following allocation applies to Batch 32:

Barrel types	In batch
Gaillac White Wine	75%
New Oak Medium Toast	10%
New Oak High Toast	10%
New Acacia Medium Toast	5%

Batch 32 displays a deep mahogany colour, darker than the normal Quadrupel. The finely pearled froth is a light brown, almost beige-like with small bubbles.

The main component of this batch is white wine from the French Gaillac region near Toulouse. Gailliac is known for its still and light sparkling white wines. The grape variety used most often in this very old white wine region are Mauzac, Len de l’el and Muscadelle. These wines have subtle aromas of dried tropical fruit, apple, honey and dates. These aromas and flavours can also be detected in this unique beer. Batch 32 was aged in these casks for more than two years.

The flavour can be described as explosive, whereby the tannins of the oak and of vanilla manifest front and centre. The finish is slightly acidic due to the barrels that contained the white wine.

The alcohol is well-balanced with the sweetness and the low bitterness of this Quadrupel. Just like the aroma, the flavour is very complex. Discover for yourself how this batch also results in a genuine degustation beer.",1.0

The aroma of Batch 26 is refreshing, floral and slight acidy (that comes from the white wine barrels). The characteristic aroma of vanilla and smoked oak is associated with cognac and in the background, a touch of malt and caramel scent.
The taste can be describes as explosive in which the wood tannins dominate. The full-bodied taste of this batch pushed the La Trappe Quadrupel to the background, yet it is definitely present. In addition, you taste the dominant flavours of honey, sweet caramel and fine oak.
The stimulating mouthfeel comes from the carbonation. Wood tannins also play a major role.

This Quadrupel Oak Aged has a deep-bronze colour topped with an amber head. Its aroma is defined by mixed wood and honey notes. These are followed by vinous flavours with a lingering port- or sherry-like scent.

The taste is quite smooth and full. For a Quadrupel this batch is rather dry and well-rounded as a result of a long maturing period in oak or acacia barrels. A two-year aging period is sufficient even if the full taste of this batch, if properly stored, warrants a good couple of years of enjoyability. Besides the effects exerted by red wine and brandy barrels, this Oak Aged also underwent Oloroso influences.

In addition, we can recognise vanilla, almond, honey blossom and caramel. The aroma of this Oak is therefore highly complex.

It has a rich, mature and strong flavour. Still, it is soft and creamy, and this batch may well be the softest produced so far. The taste buds will be hit not just by the ‘walnut-like’ oloroso. As the wine is slightly acidic, the alcohol feels warm. The oak barriques have slightly tempered the bitterness of the Quadrupel and have maintained the influences of the oloroso.

Product description

Ageing provides it with a strong taste different to that of its original version. Although the beer retains its dark colour, the head is more refined and lighter. This vintage beer has a woody aroma with a few mild notes of vanilla. It also reveals ester aromas (banana, pear, apricot).

To the palate, it is a rounded, creamy beer. Amongst its sweet and roasted accents, it shows perfect balance, despite a higher alcohol content than its predecessor. Its refined sparkling properties add the finishing touch to the unique character of an exceptional product.

TYPES OF BARREL

The idea of course is based on using different types of wood, however for this first batch, all the barrels are new and made from oak.

64% of this oak is sourced from France and 36% from America.

The batch n°1 was exclusively produced in 15,000 bottles. It has fermented in new oak casks for nearly 6 months. It has therefore acquired a beautiful dark colour over time and has become a well-balanced product.

Rye adds sweetness and complexity to the pilsner and aromatic malts. The spice of the rye is somewhat subdued at lower temperatures but becomes more apparent as the beer warms. Cascade and centennial hops were used for both flavor and aroma, adding floral and citrus notes to play off the strengths of the yeast. Belgian candi sugar was added during fermentation to bump up the alcohol while allowing the beer to avoid finishing too sweet.

I believe there will be many takers for this tide. It begins with a soft and spicy floral nose. The brett notes are measured and reverberate around the lemon-cream-pie hops like ripples around a buoy in a beam sea. Wood notes drift and float by and bring a bit of vanilla toward the end but mostly the wood does the important work of softening the heat of a multi-phase fermentation that is three fathoms deep. Putting a snifter of this beer up to your lips is like putting a conch shell up to your ear. Living right up against the Atlantic Ocean here in Delaware nothing says welcome home to me so much as the rhythmic crashing of an incoming surf on land and I get that familiar feeling while drinking The Tide and Its Takers. Like a powerful ocean you cannot take this beer for granted. It's complex, it has a lunar-pull that makes you reflexively go for the next sip, and it puts you in the right mood to appreciate life and nature's bounty. To paraphrase folk-punk Michelle Shocked, You know you're in the largest state of mind in the union when you're anchored down in Anchorage. Cheers!

The alcohol strength and flavor is clearly evident. Our Tripel’s medium body and high alcohol content contribute a pleasant vanilla like creaminess. This beer is highly carbonated to bring flavor to the forefront. As this beer warms, its flavors flourish. What’s in a beer name? In this case, the brewery’s name.

The result is a refined sparkling beer with a lively head and elegant aftertaste.

Some of this wort made it into a “funk” tank to ferment with bacteria and a blend of ale, Brett and sherry yeasts, but a large quantity was bottled in one of the brewery’s earliest bottle-conditioning projects. When the bottles didn’t carbonate properly, a resourceful brewer blended nearly 100 cases of beer with the original “funk” tank beer and transferred it into oak barrels. Fast forward to 2013, and this beer has aged with a finely developed Brett character, but only minimal tartness. Splinter Brown’s third flavor profile was created by blending the barrel-aged beer with a fresh-brewed sour mash fermented with a Belgian yeast strain and aged for six months in French and Hungarian oak wine barrels. This unique merger of flavors has resulted in a wonderfully complex Sour Brown Ale that is truly a labor of love. Cheers!",

These two wild yeast blends were pitched separately into two 500lt French cognac barrels with 500lt of brown ale wort.

Fermentation kicked off overnight and the two beers were left to do their thing for about a year. The result is two unique wild beers with amazing levels of complexity and flavour. Both are tart and have sour characters, and each have a unique texture and profile.",

Strong stock ales were brewed during the autumn and laid down in wood to mature.

Our recreation is made with our own well water, Organic Suffolk barley, English Organic Goldings hops and aged in wood with a mixed culture of wild yeasts and bacteria. We have used large quantities of whole hops to act as an antiseptic and brewed the beer at the start of the colder British months to give the wild yeast an advantage, just as the brewers did 200 years ago. A heady aroma of sweet malts, floral hops and funk is followed by a complex yet drinkable flavour of bitter grassy hops, slight candy sugar and earthy musty yeast.

It is not overly bitter, but as it matures it gives way to a more mellow strength from the malt as well as the hops.

The wild yeasts inhabiting the brewery give all the beers made there a common thread, creating a family of beverages with rare harmony, despite their diverse styles. 

Decidedly refreshing despite the 7.5% ABV, this style of beer was originally brewed in the slow winter season as payment for farmhands in the summer. We certainly don't mind sitting down after a long day of work and breathing deep the symphony aromas wafting from the lofty, lacey head burgeoning from our tulip glass. Subtle notes of peaches, apricots, canned pineapple, bitters, and a faint herbaceousness belie the smooth and delicate taste.

Springtime brings revival. Doors are thrown open and scents of a blossoming world greet us. We want a refreshing beer to drink along with it. Welcome, Bière de Mars. 

With roots in Northern France, Bière de Mars is an offshoot of a style known as Bière de Garde, brewed in early spring, then stored in cool places for consumption throughout the warm summer months. 

The Bière de Mars style is meant to be consumed immediately, as freshly as possible. You’ll see why.

We use a blend of rye, barley, and wheat to completely round out the flavor and bring back the traditional feel of a Sahti. We use an antique wheat from Germany that has remained unchanged for hundreds of years. We smoke a small percentage of the grains over pecan wood in order to draw away from the juniper flavor. There is a focus on keeping the additions light enough that the smoke flavor only really comes out after your sip, not on the palate with the flavors of the ale itself. As with a traditional Sahti, the grains are filtered through a bed of juniper that we trim off of local trees the day we brew. We also add in crushed juniper berries to improve the juniper flavor without adding too much of a resin taste from the branches. In place of Finnish baking yeast, we use Belgian Saison yeast to add the peppery, clover, and bready characteristics that are traditionally attributed to this style of ale.
We can't guarantee that this is anything like what the vikings would have drank, but enough research and planning has gotten us a fantastic ale that, Viking or not...will make you want to smash heads..",

These two were blended together on 11 April 2018 and left together to co-ferment for nearly 3 months when on July 3 we blended in barrel #1777, an 8 month old barrel of a similar NSW culture fermented lager beer wort. It was packaged on the same day at 5.5% ABV and 0.01P (1.000 SG). We packaged just under 1,000 bottles of St Florence: Sauvignon Blanc.

Next up for Tart of Gold was a relaxing couple of weeks in the fermentation tank like it’s in a cruise ship overflowing with Chardonnay wine grapes. The grapes leave behind a beer that is saturated with white wine character to the point of confusion. Last leg of the journey takes it from fermentation vessel to keg, then from the keg to the glass you find in front of you.

On an early morning in January, we drove up to the Hunter arriving to the Tyrrell's Estate to try and beat the 40+ C heat predicted for the day and got to work hand harvesting beautifully ripe Semillon grapes. We finished before it got too hot and headed back to Sydney. We chilled the grapes overnight and the next morning transferred all of these whole bunch, hand harvested grapes into a variable capacity stainless steel vessel without destemming or crushing. We sealed the tank and allowed fermentation to naturally begin via the native yeasts on the skins of the grapes. After three weeks of sealed, carbonic maceration, we removed the juice at the bottom of the ferment and blended in two barrels of Gold and allowed the fruit to macerate and referment with the beer for 4 months. In June we blended in another two barrels of Gold for necessary structure and balance and packaged on 19 June and allowed to go through a tertiary fermentation for carbonation and conditioning for 11 weeks before release.

This saison-esque science project gets complexity and fermentable sugars from the addition of two unique white wine grapes, sourced with our friends at Alexandria Nicole Cellars in Prosser, Washington.

The first addition is the must of viognier grapes that have been infected with a benevolent fungus called botrytis. This 'noble rot' reduces the water content in the grapes while magnifying their sweetness and complexity.

The second is a pinot gris intensified by a process called 'dropping fruit,' where large clusters of grapes are clipped to amplify the quality and distinction of those left behind.

We then aged Noble Rot in one of our oak tanks for an entire year, making for a hazy ale that has a spicy white wine body and a dry, tart finish.",

We have brought wine and beer together!

We love wild yeasts and ingredients at the Wild Beer Co and frequently use locally foraged ingredients. We decided to team up with a nearby wine producer to create a beer with incredible locality and a truely wild character.

Grape must is discarded as a waste product at vinyards, only the juice is kept. However, this is where all the natural, wild yeasts are and we wanted to harness these unique bugs to sour bring them to beer. We used white grapes at the beggining of the fermentation to add sourness and then red grapes in the conditioning to add extra flavour and funk.

Using our proprietary Somerset yeast, captured in local cider orchards, and harnessing the wild yeasts and bacteria from English grapes, this beer's favour is rooted in its locallity.

Taste: Rich sweet malty notes come through, before being dashed through with the somehow citrusy taste of juniper berries drying by a fireplace. Earthy spices then appear, including long forgotten herbal aromas that are strangely familiar, as if remembering a childhood hike through nature, or the wild, gnarly, primeval end of your grandmothers herb garden.

As the beer warms, even the bitterness starts coming through as a rounded, medicinal quality rather than aggressive hops.

Finally, the gentle carbonation lifts the creamy notes from the bourbon barrels, adding a delicate smoothness to the beer.

Appearance: Copper red with a quickly fading beige head.

Nose: Bourbon vanilla and toffee comes through at first, joined by hints of a jammy Berry character. As the head dissipates some aromas of farmhouse bread spice start to dominate, before being joined by a sweet and spicy herbal character - rosemary, eucalyptus and more.",1.0

The story behind the beer:

Recently, Frau Ortrud Ulrich - head librarian at the German Bier Bibliothek, the library of beer knowledge on Roundworld - arrived at her office to find a small pile of empty peanut husks and banana skins along with a significant amount of Discworld Beer sitting amongst piles of carefully sorted returned books. A hastily scribbled note, found along with these items, read simply “Ooook”.

Frau Ulrich of course reached out to us. So far we have been able to piece together the only part of the puzzle. It would seem that Unseen University's Librarian has traversed L-space while bringing with him a stash of cans of of L-space Voyager. We can only imagine he meant for us to get them into the hands of you, the Roundworld fans.

The only change we made to Pulp was to lower the bitterness to virtually zero so that we could compensate for any increased perceived bitterness from it’s additional volume of dry-hopping. One giant dry-hopping of Citra during fermentation brings out sweet tropical notes of mango, papaya, and orange starburst; then its second equally massive dry-hopping after fermentation provides gorgeous notes of marmalade, tangerine juice, and Orange BANG! straight from the fountain.

Bitter Monk Belgian Double IPA is such a beer. Redolent of citrusy hop bittering and massive malt infusion, this is a beer to ponder, to sip, and, even for a monk, to dream. Why then is the monk so bitter? What provokes that sly smile? What is he wearing under that flowing robe? A triple-fermented beer gives him three times the mystery.

Each one release one year, one month and one day from the previous year’s edition. The inspiration for this year's edition comes from a trip to Belgium taken by Stone Brewmaster Steve Wagner and Head Brewer Mitch Steele in early 2008. There they discovered a special edition of a renowned Belgian golden triple that had been extra hopped up with American hops. Back in Escondido, we opened the bottle and found that it was good. Very good, in fact. Being the hop lovers that we are, we found the whole experience deliciously inspiring. Our Stone 08.08.08 Vertical Epic Ale is a variation on this theme. We proudly present you with this very dry pale golden beer which sports a thick, creamy white foam, is spicy, estery and fruity (from the yeast), and possesses a crisp bitterness - oh yes, and is very, very generously hopped. It's fair to say that this is a beer that was inspired by a Belgian beer that was in turn inspired by the well-hopped West Coast style beers - which are, of course, the very kind of brews that we are famous for!

IPA is our go-to style here at BrewDog; from Punk to Hardcore, Jack Hammer to Atlantic IPA, we have majored in bringing you as many hop-forward beers to you as is humanly possible.

We wanted to brew a completely new and conceptual IPA that paid tribute to the style’s origins whilst incorporating the devastatingly modern techniques and technologies. A 21st Century drink with an 18th Century ethos; a very new yet very old IPA.

We found our inspiration from a doctor. The ‘father of Pharmacology’ Dr Jonathan Pereira to be precise. In 1843 he published a book which shook the establishment. Titled ‘A Treatise on Food and Diet’.

Screw any semblance of balance. This beer is like injecting hops straight into your tongue with a needle. Inspired by that other great era for India Pale Ales, the mid-nineteenth Century, Restorative Beverage is going to be impossible to remonstrate with, or counter. Its entire foundation exists on the basis of scientific fact.

The good Doctor had spoken. Restorative Beverage for Invalids and Convalescents is medical opinion writ large. History brought to life. It is the biggest, baddest, most uplifting IPA we have ever made.",

This beer strikes a balance between the unique flavour of wet hop brewing, the unfulfilled potential of UK hop varieties, and the more modern flavour of US varieties.

We assembled a team from the brewery and headed bright and early to Harewood. The team harvested nine varieties in total, including Challenger, Early Bird and Goldings. The target was 70kg of hops, 9 times higher than our normal whirlpool hopping rate to counter the high water content of freshly harvested hops. Once the van was full, we rushed these hops back to the Old Flax Store just in time to reinvent the mash tun as a hop back and soak all these lovely hops in the freshly boiled wort.

After fermentation we dry hopped with a new, exciting UK variety called Godiva which presents potent notes of tangerine and a hint of white grape, like a UK-bred Nelson Sauvin. We also threw in a small addition of Citra to contribute touches of tropical fruit but not so high as to hide the subtlety and floral, citrus notes of the fresh UK hops.",1.0

Devil’s Backbone, Dogfish Head, Sierra Nevada, Stoudt’s, Lawson’s Finest Liquids, and Trillium collaborated to create one of the festival’s signature beer Pat-Rye-Ot, a pale ale that pays tribute to America’s original homebrewers. During the process two brewers in particular were fascinated by a new hop product that was used in Pat-Rye-Ot. The product: lupulin powder. The fascinated brewers: Sean Lawson and JC Tetreault.

Lupulin powder is essentially a super concentrated hop product made by flash freezing and then shattering intact hop flowers.

We’d waited a long time to brew a single hop IPA with our small 2019 allocation burning a metaphorical hole in our cold store, and what better time than the start of a new patrons series devoted to showcasing our favourite varieties individually?

We built a grist of super pale malt, wheat, malted and flaked oats, backed with a touch of maltodextrin for extra robustness. We added our first Nelson Sauvin as a 5g/l whirlpool hopping addition before dry hopping over 3 additions to a total of 26g/l through fermentation.

Although it is the US varieties that get most attention and widest usage, Australian varieties have some truly unique qualities and can pack equally a fruity punch. We chose to focus on two varieties – Enigma and Topaz.

Enigma became a big favourite in the brewhouse last year and we’re looking forward to trying it out more through the autumn. It has a pretty unique profile bringing to mind melon, pinot grigio and the ever-popular juicy tropical fruit character to back it up. It pairs excellently with the resinous qualities of Topaz, which shines in IPA’s with notes of orange and lychee.

As a base for these flavours we put together a grist of malted and flaked oats and filled out further with maltodextrin. We also threw in some citra for bonus tropical fruit and Columbus for a balancing touch of pepper and pine.",1.0

Pouring a hazy light straw color, this IPA evokes a bevy of bright citrus grove aromas on the nose underpinned by highlights of tropical fruit and young white wine. The palate follows offering deep flavors of fresh orange, ripe papaya and ruby red grapefruit that converge with a vinous profile of succulent white peach, gooseberry, and passion fruit.

For the love of Vampires, craving not the expulsion of life but a modicum of humanity. The ultimate salve was Akasha, the non-dimensional holographic imprint of a perfect form.

It’s a little-known fact that Vampires are massive hop heads. A tipping of our hat to Brisbane punk rock band Vampyre Lovers, we teamed up with Sydney legends Akasha, to drive hop flavour on a blood-red malt base. Two new hop varieties Sabro and Bru-1 bring a cavalcade of pineapple, coconut, vanilla and passionfruit flavours. A totally new experience in hops. It’s a complex beast, with extra bite.

A wonderful amber red colour, which comes from the specialty malts, but used in a way that the isn’t overly malty. The malt delivers a sweet caramelly malt note that marries perfectly with the fruity hops, and highlighted with the piney character from the Centennial hops.

An American original reimagined.

Sit yourself down at the bar, and sip on our rye imperial pale ale aged in Heaven Hill bourbon barrels. For our latest barrel aged concoction, we decided to pay homage to one of the original, classy cocktails that would truly test our ability to balance flavours. What's more, it's in 660ml bottles and hand labelled and wax dipped for that extra touch.

The Old Fashioned takes our well-loved orange and ginger double IPA, and infuses it with the smooth, warming, vanilla character of Heaven Hill’s famous Kentucky straight bourbon. Sweet and rich on the nose, you’ll likely be surprised at just how reminiscent of its namesake it is. The vanilla and oak from the barrel brings out the sweeter notes in the orange and ginger on the palate, but the hops give that distinct bitterness you’d expect in the cocktail itself and a lasting warmth in the finish. It has also been conditioned in bottle, allowing it to develop a rich, smooth texture that goes down a treat.

This has a pale ale base with lots of hops and citrus fruits; you want to taste the freshness. It is not for extended maturation. Despite its bottle conditioning, it will not benefit from extended aging, as we have matured it in barrels already.",
42,Audition (Barrel-Aged Ruthless Rye IPA),IPA - Rye,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,3.9,692,8.9% ABV,07/25/13,"""The past winter, we siphoned some of our spicy and rugged seasonal IPA into bourbon barrels. Before sealing them for nearly three-month hibernation, we dosed the vessels with whole-cone Comet and East Kent Golding hops - a nod to how traditional IPAs were prepped for sea voyages. The explosive aroma seesaws between tropical fruit and vanilla, an overall sweetness tames the barrels' kick, which holds the remnant spice of rye.""",1.0

Named for the male Kiano, meaning ""full of joy"", this beer is packed full of citrus-forward hops, layered over the spicy rye malt base. Three months in the barrel works to punch up the rye character, while adding a touch of heat. The resulting beer weighs in at 9.2% ABV, packing a rhino-sized wallop. Despite their rough exterior, our rhino friends have a softer, artistic side as well. The artwork on this bottle is a reproduction of the actual artwork the family painted for us with their prehensile lip!

Straight Outta The Laboratory pours a hazy bright tangerine and has aromas of freshly squeezed citrus, lime, grapefruit, and a tropical character that makes actual tropical fruit green with envy. The flavor is explosive with notes of bright tropical orange juice, mango smoothie, and dank grass.

Respect). Tying into the Latin references Mortalis uses, we decided on a recipe that showcases some of our new favorite hops to pay homage to the OG of hops and Lupus Salictarius was born.

We started off with a base of 2 row, flaked oats and white wheat before adding a giant addition of Citra and Idaho7 in the whirlpool. We dry hopped with some of our favorites; Citra, Nelson, and Galaxy to finish it of with a big bang. This triple is an absolute explosion of tropical dankness.

It pours an intensely hazy glowing tangerine color releasing a penetrating hop blast of bright tropical mango, pineapple, apricot, and berry. The taste is blended tropical fruit that showcases the EQ juice experiments to date while remaining fluffy but with a proper bitterness for balance.

Following the previous Fractal Sets and continuing the series framework, we scaled up from Fractal using a super simple grain bill of 2row and our specific fractal fermentation profile before intensely hoping it with a Citra whirlpool and a dryhop of Sabro, Strata Galaxy, and Amarillo.

Super Fractal Mandelbrot Set pours a vivid hazy yellow with an aroma of tropical citrus and grapefruit. The flavor comes alive with decadent tangerine, stone fruit, and berry, with a touch of coconut and a zesty lime finish. Dramatic fruit notes take the lead as a crushable and #EQjuice profile builds up into a smooth and creamy finish that will leave you seeing the biggest fractal reflections yet.",

After thoroughly enjoying Super Fractal Phoenix Set, we wanted to grow Super Fractal as a series using hops exclusively from New Zealand and the Super Fractal Koru Set was born. Scaled up 3x from Fractal, we used a super simple grain bill of 2row and our specific fractal fermentation profile before intensely hoping it with Nelson, Motueka, Waimea, Rakau, and Wakatu.

Super Fractal Koru Set pours a vivid hazy yellow with an aroma of tropical citrus and lime. The flavor is bright candied orange peel, black currant, and white grapes with a light lime finish. This is a crazy one with some intense fruit tones. This beer is extremely aromatic and crushable with a big #EQjuice profile that might just leave you seeing beautiful and spirals shapes yet again.",

The taste is highly resinous, dank-citrus, pine juice, with a chewy mouth feel and a firm and pointed bitterness.",

We ended up taking EQ’s SOTL grain bill, modified an aggressive Other Half hopbill of Galaxy and Citra, and ran it through the SOTL process to bring out the EQ juice. This is how dreams are made.

Dream Lab pours a glowing opaque tangerine color releasing aromas of passion fruit, lime, peach, and pineapple all integrated with a bright citrus backdrop. The taste is a bright creamy tropical flavor loaded with a big juicy profile. Its escalating brightness is buoyed by a soft velvety mouth feel making it extremely well balanced and drinkable.",

Despite the distance, this year will be no different. Following on from the DDH IPA and the DDH DIPA that came before, it was only right to embark into Triple IPA territory. Not wanting to mess with a formula that isn’t broken, we went with a trusted grist of wheat malt and flaked oats over a base of super pale barley.

We brewed with soft water accentuated with chloride for mouthfeel and fermented with our preferred NE-style English ale yeast strain. We pulled together hop varieties that served us well for Infinity Vortex in the shape of the classic combination of Citra and Mosaic, the under-praised citrus and honeydew melon notes of El Dorado and Cashmere, alongside Strata for its punchy passionfruit, dank grapefruit and strawberry character.",

We find the cornbread lends a pleasant textural character and subtle maize aroma. We fermented in stainless steel with our mixed culture, which always lends natural variation to the beer. In this case, we get restrained fruity esters in the nose, which lend a slight sort of Trappist character. All in all, we find Cornbread Kvass to be one of the more unique beers we've made, while simultaneously presenting quite ""clean"" and drinkable.

We brewed a new lightly dark 3.5% ABV recipe with pale malt (Campbell), Vienna malt (Voyager) and raw rye all the while keeping the bread as the star of the show at over 30% of the total grain weight (have a look at the mash below). I wanted to keep the ABV very low as to pay homage to traditional Kvass (0.5-1% ABV). Since we used malted barley in making this product for the fermentables rather than sugar or fruit, I would submit Daily Bread to be inspired by kvass rather than an example of the drink. We mashed slightly warm for complete fermentation, lightly hopped with Saaz (CZ) and pitched our house culture of brewers yeast and foraged wild yeast and bacteria from New South Wales. The beer aged in stainless for 2 weeks before being packaged on 17 October 2018. It then conditioned in bottle, as all our beers do, for 15 weeks. Daily bread is 3.5% ABV.

At release, the aroma is dominated by cereal and toast with smoky undertones. Its palate is lively and crisp with a clean acidity and salinity lending some surprising length to a low alcohol beer.

Like all our beers, Daily Bread is best enjoyed when decanted off a settled natural yeast sediment at cellar temperatures (10-12°C).",

German doctors often recommend Schwarzbier for nursing mothers. Our Brewmaster, born in Munich, was the beneficiary of just such advice.

We have taken the traditional Schwarzbier, intended to be a “session beer” with typically moderate alcohol, and almost doubled its strength to 7.6% alcohol by volume. We brewed our version with a fine balance of German crystal and roasted malts and spiced it with German Tradition hops. We fermented 5 O’Clock Shadow at cold temperatures with a select German lager yeast and cold-conditioned it for sixteen weeks to create a velvety smooth, easy drinking springtime brew.

There they collaborated on a beer representative of our presence in Germany and the craft beer crusade we have been on and never lost sight of despite all of the words of criticism. Too aggressive, too many hops, too expensive, too impossible to break into centuries of German tradition…all of that was just words. It didn’t break us.

This Bohemian-Style Export Lager made through decoction mashing with 100% imported German Pilsner malt and bittering with imported Saaz hops. It is cold-conditioned and naturally carbonated through a four-week lagering period with Bohemian lager yeast.

23,Sushi Beer,Lager - Japanese Rice,Fieldwork® Brewing Company,3.7,577,5% ABV,11/02/16,"Few beer styles are more perfectly paired with food than Japanese Rice Lagers and sushi. Unfortunately for us pescaphiles, Rice Lagers have less variation and innovation than notebook paper; hence Sushi Beer Citra Rice Lager. A rice heavy grain-bill makes this Lager appear lighter and less malty on the palate combines with a pinch of specialty grain providing that trademark Rice Lager profile. Uncommon in the style traditionally, we dry hopped with a heap of Citra hops; providing a bombardment of orange zest, tangerine juice, mango, and slight ganja notes. A light bitterness keeps this beer respectful of your palate's needs, not beating it up or shredding tastebuds; resulting in a beer that can complement the most delicate Ahi in the world without detracting from it like most any other craft beer would. We dream of one day putting back a pint of Sushi Beer Citra Rice Lager in Tsukiji with some fresh sashimi, but in the meantime we'll gladly drink pint after pint at our favorite sushi joints in our great home of Northern California.",

These beers are almost a decade in the making, and it is with great excitement and palpable joy that we are now able to share them with you.

A Munich Dunkel, Rover honors tradition by utilizing a tedious mashing process of primarily Dark Munich malts to create flavors and aromas of molten toffee, brown bread, mild chocolate, and caramel. A sturdy addition of Tettnanger hops provides balance and depth. A clean dark chestnut color and wispy off-white head only adds to the mouth-watering appeal of this beer. It is thoughtful, elegant, and packed with nuance and character. 

Beers that command your attention are a wonderful thing. Beers that can fade into the background as a complementary unspoken companion to celebrate moments in life are also a wonderful thing and deserve to be held in equally high esteem.

Some of them, like Brick and Sleeman, are still around; others, such as Connors and Upper Canada, seem to have all but disappeared over time.

One day, we were musing (over a beer, of course) about how great it would be to brew one of those pioneering beers ourselves. Upper Canada came to mind as one of “the originals,” since it was instantly appreciated by beer-drinkers back before there was a real craft movement. They sort of paved the way, as they rebelled against the sameness of the big breweries. So we called up Sleeman (who today brews Upper Canada in limited quantities) and asked if we could bring Upper Canada back to Toronto, and make it only a few kilometres from where it was originally brewed.

Amazingly, they said ‘sure,’ and so we present Upper Canada Repatriation. A classic ‘rebellious’ recipe first brewed on Atlantic Avenue in Liberty Village in 1987. With a 6% ABV, a light orange colour, mild aroma and a velvety mouthfeel, this beer is a fitting tribute to the pioneers who brewed it first.

This one was a real pleasure to brew. Big thanks to Sleeman and all the ex-Upper Canada folks who helped us dial in the recipe.",1.0

Märzen, is a style that is identical to historical Vienna lagers, with the exception that it is probably brewed somewhere other than Vienna. In Germany, legally a beer can only be called Oktoberfest beer if it is brewed in Munich and served at Oktoberfest. Yes, that means that virtually any style beer can be called Oktoberfest as long as it’s brewed in Munich and served at Oktoberfest. Thus, Märzen became synonymous with Oktoberfest, and as to not confuse us Americans (too late), German brewers labeled Märzen beers to be shipped to America as ‘Oktoberfest,’ since we don’t know what the hell a Märzen is.

The first Vienna Lager was brewed in the city that gave the beer its name in 1841, and it introduced most of Europe to the clean flavour of modern lagers. We brewed ours with Vienna malt and a small amount of caramel malt, for a beautiful amber colour and bready character, and used three classic German hop varieties for a light bitterness and floral hop character. We adjusted the pH with Donzoko's own lactic acid culture, fermented it with Braybrooke's house lager yeast, and matured it cold for 30 days.

Until the 19th century, faro was very prevalent in the Brussels region. Folklore there was frequently associated with it, and the divine liquid flowed like water. Then faro fell into oblivion.

20,Zwanze 2019,Lambic - Gueuze,Brasserie Cantillon,4.25,"2,919",5.5% ABV,08/20/19,"mbic brewed March 1st, 2016, with a twist on our classique recipe of 35% unmalted wheat and 65% malted barley. The twist on this particular brew is that we substituted 15% of the pale malt for a smoked malt, which of course isn’t traditionally used in Lambic.

Historically, grains used for brewing were dried over a wood-burning, and so in all probability many beers would have had a slight smokiness to them a few centuries ago.

Could this be the case of the precursor to Lambic? Maybe, and it’s this possibility that inspired us to dream up the beer.

We only used a small quantity of smoked malt because we wanted to keep the flavor of the beer balanced – we didn’t want the smoked malt to overpower the traditional characteristics of the Lambic.

The beer was blended after two years of barrel aging, on January 26, 2018. After 20 months of bottle conditioning, this beer has developed the classic flavors and aromas typical of a Gueuze, a subtle woodiness, a slight fruitiness and a dry finish with a fine acidity. The delicate smokiness principally on the palate, brings a touch more complexity to this beer, without smothering the typical character of our Lambic.

So, have we reproduced this ancient style of beer which existed during the time when wood-smoked malts were commonplace? Nobody can know for sure, but what we do know is that the delicate smokiness of this year’s Zwanze marries well with the specific aromas and favors of Lambic.

We opted to recreate the rhubarb Lambic because very few consumers had been able to taste this beer 4 years ago, when only 300 litres had been produced. On top of this, unlike fruit crops, rhubarb production was not adversely affected by the very poor weather which hit Europe this spring. And finally, the last, perhaps most important reason of all for bringing back Zwanze 2008: my wife tells me it’s one of her favourites.",1.0

12,Zwanze 2015 - Wild Brussels Stout,Lambic - Traditional,Brasserie Cantillon,4.17,"3,152",7% ABV,04/27/15,"With its Zwanze 2015, in its own way Cantillon wanted to perpetuate this typically Belgian surrealist mindset. In doing so, a few changes were made to the recipe for a traditional stout. Specifically, I fermented some raw wheat to improve mellowness and enhance storage characteristics and did not use roasted barley to avoid further accentuating the dry aspect, which was already present as a result of spontaneous fermentation.

The recipe is that of a stout, the colour is that of a stout, and spontaneous fermentation followed by 28 months of maturing in a cask has given birth to a “surreal” stout.

The dry and tart notes of a spontaneous fermentation beer combine with the roasted, slightly burnt and delicate chocolate flavours sometimes found in certain stouts.

For the 28 months of maturing we used three types of casks: 50% of the casks had already contained lambic, 25% had already been used for CoÌ‚tes du RhoÌ‚ne wine and 25% had already been used for Cognac. Beers that have matured in old Cognac casks take up the warmth of the alcohol while those from casks having contained red wine adopt winey and fruity characteristics.

This “wild” stout’s fruitiness and “cooked” side reveal rancio flavours that are characteristic of Madeira or Banyuls wines. The ideal tasting temperature to fully enjoy these fragrances and flavours is 15 °C - 18 °C (59 °F - 64 °F).",1.0

This unique malt is heavier one the smoky side, which, together with the intense acidity, creates a wonderful base for the aromas of cherry plum. This fruit is rarely used in beers, but it grows in abundance in our neighbourhoods, so it comes as no surprise that we paired it with our sour ale.

Originally released in connection with the launch of our “What’s New?” R&D program, this Marzen notched a special place in our brewery’s history – the first beer to medal (2019 US Open Beer Championship) before full market release. Such a strong and unique response justified progression from pilot program beer to full production seasonal release.

Same Time Next Year’s foundation is its malt bill – dominated by German Vienna malt, which provides a medium body with touch of malt sweetness but complimented with notes of biscuit and a hint of caramel provided by Caramunich malt. Although hops take a back seat in this malt forward beer, Liberty hops add balance and a restrained bitterness to round out the overall Oktoberfest experience.

We partnered with our farming neighbors and friends, Moutoux Orchard, to create this Imperial Märzen made with smoked sweet potatoes, local sage, and brown sugar. Moutoux Orchard is a third generation family farm committed to sustainable, whole-diet agriculture. 

With a wink to northern Bavarian Rauchbier, we opted for a subtle smoke component — more earthy than smokey— as a guidepost for the flavors to meet. Instead of smoked grain, the sustainably-grown sweet potatoes from Moutoux Orchard were smoked at our farm with local apple and cherry wood. The sweet potatoes were then put in the 100% Virginia grain mash with local sage. Once transferred to the boil kettle, we added brown sugar. 

Post fermentation, the Imperial Märzen rested in oak puncheons at 35F for three months before bottle conditioning for another two months. The result is a flavorful beer with complexity from ingredients that have had time to get to know each other. Rauch Tater has a lush base from the malt and molasses sweetness from the brown sugar. The waft of smoke provides an earthy taste that connects the malt and molasses with a velvety mouthfeel from the sweet potatoes. This is capped with a savory and dry finish at the top, thanks to the sage. Aged in oak puncheons.",

Kwak is recognisable by its deep bright amber colour and a dense, creamy coloured head. The pale wood of the glass holder makes a pleasant contrast with the beer.

You will smell a mellow, fruity and malty aroma with a slightly spicy character (coriander, hops). Additional earthy and very subtle aromas of banana and perhaps also a whiff of pineapple or mango in the background.

Session beers são cervejas de baixo teor alcoólico onde ""menos é mais"", se tornando cervejas extremamente complexas de serem produzidas. Tal como montar um quebra-cabeça. 

E tem quebra-cabeça mais divertido do que Tetris? Nos inspiramos no clássico dos videogames, nas British golden Ales nas Juicy ales do nordeste norte-americano para resolver essa pra gente e olha só no que deu: uma cerveja onde leveza e refrescância andam de mãos dadas com intensidade e sabor marcante. Com aromas frutados típicos das variedades de lúpulos utilizadas na receita, um sabor marcante e aveludado, causado pela presença de trigo na receita e com um fermento de origem inglesa capaz de reconstruir os aromas dos lúpulos e juntar todas as peças do quebra-cabeça com maestria, a Tilt sabe ser delicada e marcante ao mesmo tempo. Assim como um Tilt, é meio difícil de explicar, sugerimos beber pra entender melhor. 


--- 

Tilt is a juicy, flavorful and fruity session beer, brewed with Citra and Mosaic hops paired with an english yeast that brings out the flavor and tilts (see what we did there?) the hop aromas into something else. Kinda hard to explain, better taste it in order to make sure you understand it!",

The beer pours a soft, hazy straw color that shimmers in the light. On the nose banana, citrus zest, floral green tea and bubblegum burst forward.

Tettnanger fresco in fiori a grandi manciate è sparso un po’ ovunque nella produzione di questa birra; in modo che in ogni fase il prodotto finito possa assimilare una diversa sfumatura d’aroma, un particolare grado di amaro, una tessera speciale che ricomponga insieme alle altre il mosaico odoroso delle strade di campagna tedesche nei giorni della raccolta.

It is a beer that pulls on the traditions of the British Porter, the Russian Imperial Stout and the lagers of Central Europe. The style dates back to the 18th century.

Divine Reserve No. 17 is a big, rich porter that is deceptively drinkable and well balanced for its 9.2% ABV. It has a pleasant sweetness that balances the roastiness of the beer without being cloying. We achieved this by using a combination of malts - Munich malt as the base, Chocolate Wheat and Brown malts for color and roastiness, and flaked oats to round out the body.

A healthy amount of Perle hops creates a balancing bitterness that is disguised by the body of the beer. The Old Bavarian lager yeast used in this beer is the same yeast used in 5 O' Clock Pils, Spring Bock and Summer Pils. This is the first lager we've brewed for the Divine Reserve series.

Imperium Prunum to imperialna (dubeltowa) wersja króla polskich piw porteru bałtyckiego. Tradycyjne portery mają 21% ekstraktu i ok. 9% alkoholu. Nasze piwo ma 26% ekstraktu, a drożdże odfermentowały je do 11% alkoholu. Piwo jest czarne, nieprzejrzyste, z beżową drobnopęcherzykową pianą. Piękne rubinowe błyski ujawniają się po każdym łyku w czasie powolnego spływania po ściance naczynia.

W aromacie uderza feeria ciemnych zapachów: kawy, kakao, czekolady i czekoladowych pralin sowicie nadzianych owocami z likieru. Wszystko to unosi się łącząc z nutami szlachetnego alkoholu oraz wędzonych owoców. Co ważne, zdecydowana wędzona nuta łącząca oba elementy kompozycji piwa pochodzi nie od wędzonych słodów, a od zastosowania Suski Sechlońskiej – wędzonej śliwki węgierki pochodzącej z okolic wsi Sechna, posiadającej unijny certyfikat Chronionego Oznaczenia Geograficznego.

Smak potwierdza wszystko to, co pojawiło się w aromacie. Płynna czekolada i najlepsze belgijskie praliny łączą się z delikatną słodyczą, palonością oraz delikatnie kwaśnym kawowym finiszem. Szlachetne, rozgrzewające nuty alkoholowe pozwalają delektować się każdym łykiem. Wszystkie elementy – niczym jesienna mgła w górskiej dolinie – łączy owocowa wędzoność śliwki.",

Do starzenia użyliśmy 20 świeżo opróżnionych, cudownych beczek po Oloroso - każda po 250 litrów. Wybraliśmy beczki po Sherry nie dlatego, że są najdroższe ;-) Ani nie dlatego, że mamy coś do wanilii z burbona ;-) Otóż próby, które prowadziliśmy na żywych Imperatorach i różnych alkoholach starzonych w drewnie wykazały, że nasz intensywnie nachmielony, imperialny porter najlepiej rozumie się z owocowo-rodzynkowym i orzechowym charakterem aromatycznego, ciężkiego, hiszpańskiego wina. Taniny z dębu, z którego zrobione są beczki nadały przyjemny, charakterystyczny ""szlif BA"" - to co miłośnicy starzenia w drewnie lubią najbardziej :-)

Ważne. Imperator Bałtycki to lager - jak każdy klasyczny ""Bałtyk"". I bardzo chcieliśmy, aby również w wersji Barrel Aged Imperator zachował charakter ułożonego, harmonijnie zbalansowanego, dobrze wyleżakowanego lagera. Przed napełnieniem beczki po winie przeszły jeszcze delikatne zabiegi pod prysznicem, aby uniknąć zakażenia, które wywróciłyby nasze sensoryczne plany do góry nogami. Do starzenia przeznaczyliśmy Imperatora po wcześniejszym 4-miesięcznym leżakowaniu w klasycznym stalowym tanku. Napełnione beczki zapakowaliśmy na kolejne 4 miesiące do pełnomorskiego, klimatyzowanego kontenera - tak by podczas starzenia temp. nie wzrosła powyżej 10°C. Piwo oprócz wzbogacenia aromatu i smaku zyskało również solidniejsza teksturę - jest jeszcze bardziej gęste i treściwsze.

Smacznego!",

Aiyyo, who slam harder? Onyx, or Vince Carter? 
When it comes to comparing these people, any argument loses its meaning. They are real ""tough guys"" - hard guys with a strong character, power and strength of spirit. They don't admit criticism and they're against censorship. They don't care what they think. They do not tell beautiful stories. Their path is as aggressive as life in the ghetto. 

In our new beer we have combined the impenetrable darkness of the Baltic coast with the fortress of the guys from Queens. Slam Harder is a confident Baltic porter, additionally aged 9 months in bourbon barrels brought from the USA. In addition to the rich flavor of roasted malt, chocolate and coffee, dry warming tones have been added, leading to a noble American drink. And 10.5% will be like Vince Carter's signature slam-dunk sung by the revolutionaries of hardcore rap.

Slam Harder's label is the result of collaboration with a graffiti artist and graphic illustrator Roman Peeks, a member of MOW/WORD crews.

We looked to coax complexity out of the marriage of a barrel's soul and a brew's potential, not just to bomb a huge beer with huge flavor. The rum that lives in these barrels for four years integrates its spice to the wood so well that it ends up reminiscent of a Bananas Foster. A sturdy brown honey porter seemed the best host to receive the ghosts from Shipwreck's old home. We started with a base of deep malts looking for notes of coffee and chocolate, then enhanced them with the floral bouquet of local wildflower honey and the preservative strength of 10% ABV while keeping the body sensible. This was put in the casks to meld with the vanilla, wood, and spice notes, toned down by the oxidative effect of a year in the cellar.

The nose is full of pumpkin pie spices and some alcohol. There are notes of nutmeg, caraway and vanilla. The taste starts with chocolate malt with a hint of spice and rolls into a warm spicy alcohol taste which has the effect of creating the balance that usually comes from the hop bitter. There is some hop bitter on the finish, but not much. Overall, this beer finishes relatively dry for such a big beer. As it warms, the spices move forward in the taste and the chocolate moves to the finish. The pumpkin provides a pleasant undertone and a nice mouthfeel.

Fruto da parceria inédita entre a Lei de Pureza e a Lei de Zoeira, criamos uma cerveja defumada em parceria com nossos amigos da Weyermann® Specialty Malts, a maltaria mais tradicional do mundo.

There was a LOT of talk about what this beer could be. The only survivor from the shipwreck of ideas between Adam Avery, Greg Koch and Thomas Tyrell had been a mutual like for Bamberd, its smoked beers, and Greg's friendship with Mahrs Bräu brewmaster Stephan Michel. With that firm affirmation in hand, a WhatsApp invitation was extended. But still, the lingering question remained: What to brew? Fortunately, this global cabal of brewing wunderkinds is nothing if not creative. The theme, appropriate for this group, was Bourbon & Pancakes. Because, obviousle. That, and Adam LOVES midnight breakfasts. Mahrs Bräu contributed Bamburg favorite Rauchbier in bock form. Adam brought the desire to age it in Maple and Bourbon barrels.

Mashed with local pilsner malt along with a curated blend of beechwood-smoked barley and cherrywood-smoked oats from our friends at @sugarcreekmaltco of Boone County, Indiana. Fermented cool with our preferred house lager yeast strain and conditioned cold for 5 additional weeks.

Employing some incredibly technical brewing skills, we sent this beer through a complex decoction mash. An old world practice, the process involves removing a portion of the main mash and bringing it up to a boil. Going through a series of steps, this process is said to provide a depth to the finished beer, not possible otherwise. In addition, a technique known as spunding, we closed off Sainnhus during fermentation in order to capture all of the CO2 being expelled and trapping it into solution. The result yields an unparalleled crisp lager beer with a frothy rocky head.

Inspired by the traditional rauchbiers of Germany, we love the intensity and complexity of smoke malt.",

Taste: With a mouthfeel like chewing on a dark and roasted black rye bread, this manages to be both richly sweet enough to be nourishing, whilst being balanced by the peppery spice of the rye malts. With an underlying spicy molasses like body and a touch of blackcurrant like fruitiness, the barrel ageing gives an additional layer of complexity - wrapping up all the other flavours in yet more spice and smooth charred oak.

Appearance: Deep, dark chestnut brown with a slight red hue and a beige head.

Nose: Rich dark fruits - figs, prunes, and raisins - and strong dark chocolate come through, with hints of winter spices such as cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and dark rye bread. Coming later are aromas of Kali, vanilla, some tobacco and huge rye - a bold yet inviting aroma that demands to be noticed.

And while it may be true that this incredibly refreshing beer and fruit soda hybrid tastes its best after you finish some sort of activity that leaves you drenched in sweat, we promise it still tastes pretty darn awesome when you’ve been sitting in the air conditioning all day. We crafted this all-rounder by brewing up a Kolsch for an ultra light, ultra clean, and ultra crisp base to mix with a big ol' pile of juicy raspberries and some house-made lemon soda. A little tart, a little jammy, and a little sweet, we promise no law dictates that you can only drink one after a pulse-pounding workout. In fact, we recommend keeping a four-pack on hand so",

The flavors of the wood, that are used to improve wine, can come out into the beer, creating oaky, and tannic flavors. The red wine itself that has soaked into the wood can also enter the beer, giving it wine and fruit flavors. Oxygen, which is present in the barrel, will also create smoky, nutty flavors similar to those found in Sherry. Finally, the are micro organisms in both the beer and the barrel that can continue maturing, producing new flavor elements as the beer ages.

Dark Sour Ale Aged in Red Wine Barrels with Zante Currants and Dates Added

In 2008 Mike and his friend Alex Howe began a tradition of homebrewing Dark Funky Saisons each fall. The recipe and results evolving and revolving over the last decade. Elliptical Orbit is our scaled-up spin on the fourth iteration, with cold-steeped dark malts, Zante currants, and dates. We aged it in Maryland Chambourcin red wine barrels for more than a year.

The result is layered with dried fruit, bright acidity, cocoa maltiness, and leathery Brett. The first entry in a renewed tradition. 

Cheers,
Mike & Scott

Dark Sour Ale in Red Wine Barrels with Cranberries and Orange Zest Added

When blending, we identify barrels that are delicious, but that don’t fit with the rest of the batch. When we compile enough of these we sit down to blend, talk, and try to put order to the chaos. Each version will be a completely different beer, unique, and impossible to recreate.

#1 is a combination of the base beers for Elliptical Orbit 2019 and Opulence all aged in red wine barrels. We added subtle amounts of cranberry and fresh navel orange zest to brighten the flavor and create a sour ale that has warming flavor for the winter.

The barrel-aged beers were selected for their aroma and acidity. After blending the beer was returned to barrels for another 3 months (in red wine barrels from which part of the original blend was drawn, plus some bourbon barrels which previously housed Acid Jam). A small addition of seasonal British fruit was added to some of the barrels. The fruit additions total ~75g/L in the overall blend, consisting of 40% cherries and 60% blackcurrants.

The resulting beer has a gorgeous oak character with prominent red wine tannin influence, bramble & berries and a fruity acidity on the palate. Of course there’s a complexity too, and our tasting notes pick up floral notes, almonds, umami and a delicate funkiness from the brettanomyces. As always, we’d love to know how your tastings compare.",

The foothill tribes, obscured in the silhouette of the mountains, live in unceasing fear of Tenaya the Shadowbeast. Tales of a cat's agility, murmurs of a fox's stealth, and whispers of a boar's tusks frightened generations.

From the faith for a day without shadow, the Red Angel burgeoned. His form vaulted over hills, his hooves steady in the high places and from his crown of antlers, a brilliant light dispelled darkness.

Immediately receptive and eager for us to engage, Jackson-Beckham accepted our invitation to visit us at Trillium for a collaborative brew day. Wanting this project to have an immediate, positive influence locally, we reached out to our friends at the Urban Farming Institute, whose values of education, community, and local agriculture align very closely with our own. Founded in 2011, UFI fosters partnerships between urban residents and farmers, with the goal of building a healthier and more locally-based food system. On Monday, January 13th, Dr. J and UFI joined us in Canton to brew Wonderful Complex Individual, a stout with sweet potato, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla.



Wonderful Complex Individual presents a deep chestnut color with a moderate haze. The aroma is complex and reminiscent of a bakery.

Coconut PM Dawn presents a dark chestnut brown color with khaki head and lacing. Bold, freshly roasted dark coffee aromas swirl to the nose accented by notes of sweet shredded coconut, toasted graham cracker, caramel and chocolate chips. On the palate, cold brew derived flavors of roasted hazelnut and melted dark chocolate interweave with a bright coconut profile calling to mind macaroons, Mounds bars, and Caribbean sugar cake. As with all of our PM Dawn variants, Coconut PM Dawn offers a medium to heavy body with a luscious mouthfeel and a light bitterness for a balanced and smooth finish.",

To accentuate the tropical notes of coconut we added in an obscene amount of sea salt which in turn helps cut through the rich oatmeal laden body to help transform what could be considered a dessert beer into a sessionable inky black elixir.

.
Let me start by saying that I love my father and that he is an amazing parent. That being said, this is him being decapitated by some ductwork. 
.
Born and raised in The Bronx (Parkchester), one of six kids in a tiny apartment, he’s a compass for hard work and appreciation for family & friends.
He gave me my first sip of beer after some summer yardwork and put me on a career path I couldn’t derail.
He guided me through some rough patches and taught me about problem solving, working with my hands and commitment to my passions.
.
The Greek word Meraki (putting something of yourself into your work), and the quote “They died doing what they loved” came to mind in paying homage to him. A “Tin Knocker” for most of his life, well liked by his peers and the pride he takes admiring his work is a thing of envy. Which is why it only made sense to have the reaper manning the controls of a crane to swing ductwork to remove his head. Featuring a NYC skyline, the label also features the colors of the wrapper of his favorite candy bar, in which I tried to emulate with the ingredients.
.
Patricide has a different grain bill than Matricide, implements different techniques and alternate amounts of ingredients to deliver a dark chocolate & coconut forward experience.
.
Cold aged for an extended stay on Ecuadorian Cacao & Toasted coconut. Intoxicating nose of rich coconut, brownie batter, black cherry brandy on a backdrop of slick coconut milk.
Deeper heavier aromatics and flavors of caramelized Hazelnuts, Black Forest cake, dry Port. Invasively viscous Coconut notes on mouthfeel, black cherry cordial, crisp fudge brownie edges, astringent bite of cacao balances at the finish.
.
With a keen interest in history, true crime, horror novels and westerns, he also may have inadvertently inspired Nightmares cornerstones. 
As a paradigm for a tough as nails New Yorker, and with his love for westerns this beer

Old Chimneys, whose Good King Henry sets the bar for British-style imperial stout across the globe, and Wander Beyond who over the last couple of years have continued to push the ABV and flavour boundaries with their decadent creations.

We tried to bring together the best of both styles, putting together a classic, complex stout grist of roast barley and pale chocolate malt, a touch of crystal, plenty of munich malt and copious oats plus plenty of additional sugars for fermentability.

After fermenting with a classic English ale yeast we introduced multiple additions of chocolate and vanilla, building up layers of velvet delight, aiming for a true taste of indulgence in a glass.

Lastly, we let this beer sit on a bunch of chocolate in the fermenter to round out the stout and mocha driven concepts.

We built up a layered malt base with Extra Pale Ale, Rolled Oats, Flaked Barley, Light Munich, Smoked Malt, Carapils and Maltodextrin for the complex flavours and mouthfeel you get in a stout without the depth of colour. We paid special attention to the water, treating it to create a more creamy mouthfeel supplemented with lactose.

“As a finished blend, XX is a beautifully textured and complex brew, with layers that unfold as the beer opens up. At first there is a burst of brandy soaked cherries, then chocolate cake combined with distinct boozy new American oak notes. The flavor develops full of molasses rich brown sugar and fruitcake with a touch of caramel and cinnamon spice. Overall the beer is silky smooth, incredibly balanced and finishes with a touch of kirsch filled truffle – a perfect blend of everything we love about our vintage barrel program! This beer is unfiltered and unfined, so there will be a small amount of sediment in the bottom of the bottle. XX is best enjoyed poured carefully into a half filled brandy snifter or wine glass. Allow it to warm to 55F to fully enjoy the pleasing and complex aromas. As the beer sits and breathes in the glass the true complexity of this blend is revealed, so take your time.

If you wait to open your bottle later, store it in a cool dark place. Like our other Anniversary offerings, this beer will age well and change favorably for years to come. It was an absolute pleasure in the making and I truly hope you enjoy our 12th oak-aged blend! The journey continues.

This beer is dedicated to all of the new mothers and fathers within the FW Family and to their little ones who are our future.

Chief among them they began their rise to prominence in the late 1990’s with big, bold beers, and these gents are, shall we say, full of braggadocio, swagger and unrepentant joie de vivre. Also in common was the way in which, with aggressive intention, they each so cavalierly sabotaged norms that had been so irresponsibly led by the lowest common denominator purveyors of industrial beer. Thus, it’s only natural that having first met in Piozzo, Italy in 2000, the pair found themselves to be international comrades and lifelong friends in the craft beer revolution.

This beer needs to be sufficiently scaled to the personalities brewing it. Therefore, it is unquestionably full of braggadocio, swagger and unrepentant joie de vivre.

When a bourbon ages in a barrel, a portion of the bourbon evaporates - this is called the ""Angel’s share"". Another portion of the bourbon gets absorbed into the new oak barrel - this is called the ""Devil’s cut"".

40,Whaleback White,Wheat Beer - Witbier,Leelanau Brewing Company,3.83,932,5.2% ABV,11/26/10,"For a beer in a style that was almost extinct, this one has a whole lot of life. Wit (or white) beers were a popular style in Belgium for five hundred years, and even a century ago there were many artisan producers; but in the post-war years the last of the traditional white beers ceased production. Now, decades after the style's resurrection, a handcrafted ale replete with the complexities and liveliness that endeared generations of beer aficionados is available again.

White beers are different from other wheat beers by the addition of orange peel and spices like coriander; this one is distinguished from all other wit beers in a few important ways. Handmade at the much lauded Jolly Pumpkin Brewery by Ron Jeffries, one of the world's great brewers, this ale is spontaneously fermented by their signature wild yeasts. This results in a beverage of uncommon vitality, so much more genuine than even the finest of many a craft brewery. Aging in a custom barrique of new French oak is a traditional, but exceedingly rare practice that lends the Leelanau beers an unmistakable character and defines Whaleback White as a style that we call Michigan Bière Blanche.

Pouring a pale golden color, the evidence of bottle conditioning swirls through the glass as the head reaches for the top and releases lightly fruity, slightly grassy aromas. Tart notes of lemon and orange carry from the aroma to the body where they are joined by hints of coriander and curacao, making for a complex yet restrained flavor. Full bodied, but finishes with a crisp champagne finish. Nuanced enough for the most developed palate, yet accessible enough to be a great introduction to farmhouse styles of beer for the uninitiated. 

The balance of complexity and refreshment makes this a beer fit for many situations. We enjoy it with chevre and honey, most any fresh fish grilled outside on a balmy afternoon, or with Thai cuisine that packs plenty of heat. We've been known to take a few bottles on trips to the lakeshore, where its kept chilled buried in the sand, waiting to be enjoyed over a lazy fire of driftwood.",

We brew the base with Scarlet variety barley from Alamosa CO and 33% White Wheat, then with a light bittering hand of hops and aroma infuse Cardamom, Coriander, Lemon Grass and Mandarin rinds at the end of the kettle. We used an new selection of yeast for primary in stainless then racked to neutral white wine barrels for one month of aging. We usually see another pick up in fermentation from a house yeast, then rack to bottling and natural fermentation in the bottle/keg for carbonation.

Man can only see himself when he mirrors himself in another person. When oneness divides itself in two, it results in a meeting of souls, the creation of something new, the incarnation of a child. Without the concept of two there is no together, without being together there is no Twee.

This collab with Tommie Sjef Wild Ales is a blend of a two-year-old beer from his barrelhouse blended with a young saison from our brewery. This blend was put back in barrels for a year until it was rich enough to be harvested. To finetune its balance we blended it for a second time with a young barrel-aged beer. Twee can therefore be seen as a double bière de coupage. It is a wonderfully rustic beer with outspoken fruity notes of orange, peach and apricot. Its taste profile is defined by aged hops and our wild house culture, offering a good dose of dried hay, damp cellar and mineral stone. There is a good balance between sour and bitter notes in the rich structure of this beer.
